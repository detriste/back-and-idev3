This is a large database of mime types and information about them.
It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic,
allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API.
It aggregates data from the following sources:

- https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
- https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
- https://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types

## Installation

```bash
npm install mime-db
```

### Database Download

If you intend to use this in a web browser, you can conveniently access the JSON file via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), a popular CDN (Content Delivery Network). To ensure stability and compatibility, it is advisable to specify [a release tag](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db/tags) instead of using the 'master' branch. This is because the JSON file's format might change in future updates, and relying on a specific release tag will prevent potential issues arising from these changes.

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jshttp/mime-db@master/db.json
```

## Usage

```js
var db = require('mime-db')

// grab data on .js files
var data = db['application/javascript']
```

## Data Structure

The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased mime types.
Each mime type has the following properties:

- `.source` - where the mime type is defined.
    If not set, it's probably a custom media type.
    - `apache` - [Apache common media types](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
    - `iana` - [IANA-defined media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
    - `nginx` - [nginx media types](https://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)
- `.extensions[]` - known extensions associated with this mime type.
- `.compressible` - whether a file of this type can be gzipped.
- `.charset` - the default charset associated with this type, if any.

If unknown, every property could be `undefined`.

## Note on MIME Type Data and Semver

This package considers the programmatic api as the semver compatibility. This means the MIME type resolution is *not* considered
in the semver bumps. This means that if you want to pin your `mime-db` data you will need to do it in your application. While
